### Database is diasbled.

Owlbear Rodeo uses a local database to store saved data. If you are seeing a database is disabled message this usually means you have data storage disabled. The most common occurrences of this is if you are using Private Browsing modes or in Firefox have the Never Remember History option enabled. The site will still function in these cases however all data will be lost when the page closes or reloads.
