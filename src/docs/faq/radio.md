## Using Radio (experimental)

### No audio found in screen share.

When using audio sharing you must select the **Share audio** option when choosing the browser tab or screen to share. Support for sharing audio depends on browser and operating system. Currently Google Chrome on Windows allows you to share the audio of any tab or an entire screen while on MacOS you can only share the audio of a tab. For an example of selecting the **Share audio** option for a tab on MacOS see Figure 1.

### Browser not supported for audio sharing.

Using audio sharing relies on the browser supporting the audio capture feature of the Screen Capture API. Currently the two browsers that support this are Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. To see if your browser is supported see the [Browser Compatibility chart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia#Browser_compatibility) on the Mozilla Developer Network.
