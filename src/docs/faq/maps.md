## Games & Maps

### I’ve added a map to my game, why can’t my players see it? 

This could be because it’s taking a while to upload. Ensure that your players can see a loading bar at the top of the site. Owlbear Rodeo will do its best to load a lower quality map, before continuing to load in higher quality. See 'How big can my maps be?' in our faqs.

### Why do some of my tokens have a question mark on them?

This means that the token hasn’t loaded in just yet. If they still haven’t loaded in after some time, try giving the page a refresh. You should see load progress on the loading bar at the top of the website. 

### How big can my maps be?

Owlbear Rodeo doesn't impose a limit on map sizes but keep in mind the larger the map you upload the longer it will take for your players to load and the harder it will be for your computer to run. We recommend trying to keep your maps under 10MB with a good internet connection and under 5MB with slower internet. If you accidently upload a map that is too big you can use the quality option in the map's settings to lower the size without needing to re-upload your map.

### Where are my maps stored?

Your maps are stored on your local device. This means that clearing your cache will delete your maps, so please only do so if you have no other options. 

### Why am I being prompted for a password when I didn't set one?

If you're game link is over 24hrs old then this could be why you are being prompted for a password. Creating a new game won't affect any maps you have used or prepared previously. See 'How long does a game I create last?' in our faqs.

### How long does a game I create last?

We encourage users to create games every 24hrs. Any maps you have added or made edits to will not be affected and will still be available when you create another game.

### I can join my game but the spinner is constantly loading, why?

This could mean that the service is currently down. Please visit us on Twitter or Reddit and let us know.
