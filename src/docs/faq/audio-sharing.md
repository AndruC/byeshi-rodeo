## Audio Sharing

### How do I use Audio Sharing?

You can find out how to use Audio Sharing in our how-to [docs](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/how-to#sharingAudio). 

### Why isn’t audio sharing working?

Your audio sharing may not be working for a few reasons:

- Your browser doesn’t support audio sharing. Be sure that you are using Chrome for sharing audio, and that your player is is another tab in Chrome. 
- No audio found when sharing audio. 

### I’ve added a map to my game, why can’t my players see it? 

This could be because it’s taking a while to upload. Ensure that your players can see a loading bar at the top of the site. Owlbear Rodeo will do its best to load a lower quality map, before continuing to load in higher quality.
