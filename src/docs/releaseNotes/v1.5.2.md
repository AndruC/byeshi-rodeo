## Minor Changes

This release focuses on better support for small screens and adds more accessibility options.

- Map, token and dice select screens now scale properly to small screens.
- A new full screen button allows you to hide the party and token list. This helps with usability on small screens and fixes an issue where the dice tray couldn't be seen.
- Fixed map zoom speed on Firefox on Windows to align with the other browsers.
- Fixed a crash that would occur if the user had local storage disabled.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the token label width to not update when the token size changed.
- Added a new accessibility option in the game settings for Token Label Size. This is a scale applied to token labels locally and should help with those who use large maps or high resolution screens.
- Fixed a bug that caused a crash when a map was deleted with unsaved changes.
- Fixed an error that could happen when switching between two maps with custom tokens.
- Added automatic cache invalidation to custom maps and tokens. This is an attempt to keep the storage of maps from getting out of hand as people use the site more. Practically this means that there is now a limit of 100 unique custom tokens per map. I'm intending to keep an eye on this and if there are issues I can make this number bigger.
