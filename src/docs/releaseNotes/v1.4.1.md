## Minor Changes

- Added all new [How To](https://owlbear.rodeo/howTo) page with detailed tutorials on how to use Owlbear Rodeo.
- Along with text tutorials there are also video tutorials on our new [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCePe1wJC53_7fbBbSECG7YQ)
- Added a grid type option for custom maps, this will be used in a future release to set the grid to hex.
- Release notes can now be minimized and their video content viewed on the site.
- The map tools are now shown by default, this should hopefully lead to greater discoverability for new users.
- Fixed a bug with map setting changes being carried to a new map when the old map is deleted.
