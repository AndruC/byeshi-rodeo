## Minor Changes

- Fixed a bug where tokens that were placed on the map then removed from the token select screen could no longer be deleted from the map.
- Fixed a bug where fog drawing couldn't be undone if there the last fog shape was deleted.
- Added the ability to add multiple new maps or tokens at the same time.
- Added a Show Grid option for maps that will overlay a grid on the map. This can be useful for when you have a map with no grid or you want to verify your current grid settings.
- Added the ability to erase multiple shapes at a time by dragging over a shape with the eraser tool. This works for fog erase and toggle as well.
