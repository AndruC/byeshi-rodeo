## Minor Changes

This release focuses on improving performance for map zooming and asset loading.

- Custom tokens now share more data between each instance of a token saving on memory.
- Zooming is more efficient by being better at choosing which elements need to be re-rendered.
- Default image assets have been further compressed to save on network bandwidth.
- Browser compatibility has been expanded by supporting older browsers that didn't previously work with moving maps or interacting with dice.
- Sending larger maps to players will no longer hitch the UI while the map is cached.
- Using the fog brush tool has been optimised and is now less likely to result in small fog shapes on intersections.
- Shared dice rolls now only show icons for the dice that have been rolled in the expanded view mode.
- Holding down the Alt key while zooming will now activate a precision zoom mode, allowing mouse users to more precisely zoom maps.
- The game reconnection message now has a more compact UI.
