## Minor Changes

- Changed the way maps are stored and sent to other players which should fix a few of the issues with maps not sending properly.
- Added relay servers to use as a fallback for when players aren't able to create a direct connection, this should fix most issues with connection failures.
- Fixed a bug that would stop users from uploading custom maps when web storage was disabled (this mainly happened with Firefox in Private Mode).
- Added a new release notes page on the site which shows all the release notes in one place.
