## Minor Changes

This release fixes a few map sending bugs and reworks map zooming.

- Change map max zoom to be based off of the maps grid size. This means you should always be able to zoom up to see a grid cell almost fullscreen.
- Updated map zoom speed to be linear throughout it's zoom range.
- Update map zoom to be centered on the mouse instead of screen.
- Updated map grid from file name functionality to better reject non-grid values.
- Fixed a bug that caused sending large maps to fail.
- Made advanced map options shown by default.
- Renamed Show Grid map option to Draw Grid to help with the similarity with the Show Grid Controls option.
- Fixed a bug where map states sometimes wouldn't be saved if another player changed the map.
- Fixed a bug that would cause custom maps to not send to Firefox private browsing sessions.
