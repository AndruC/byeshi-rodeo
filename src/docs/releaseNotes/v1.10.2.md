## Minor Changes

This is a small release just adding some QoL improvements and updating dependencies.

- Updated most package dependencies
- Added functionality to allow imports that contain corrupted assests. Previously, having one corrupt asset would cause the import to fail. Now you should be notified if any assets were unable to be imported
- Added message about our new blog on home page
- Fixed bug that was causing animation trails on dice in Safari iOS. Unfortunately, this fix means dice appear in lower quality on Safari browsers
- Fixed toggle fog being triggered with middle mouse drag

We are currently working on some big changes that will take some time so continue to expect only minor changes.
