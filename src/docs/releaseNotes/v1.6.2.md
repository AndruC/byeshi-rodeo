## Minor Changes

This is a small release fixing a few connection bugs.

- Added automatic error reporting. This should hopefully make it easier for us to track down bugs and fix them.
- Fixed a bug where player connections sometimes weren't being cleaned up on a network error.
- Added in game notifications when players leave or join a game.
- Changed auto reconnect timing to be a little more accurate.
- Fixed a bug where full resolution maps weren't being sent if the map owner left the game and rejoined.
