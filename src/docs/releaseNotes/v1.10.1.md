## Minor Changes

This is a small release fixing a few bugs and adding some QoL improvements.

- Updated alternating diagonals measurement to fix inaccuracy with diagonal distances.
- Added support for middle mouse button move shortcut.
- Added support for right mouse button pointer shortcut.
- Optimised note creation to reduce lag when creating a note on FireFox.
- Fixed a bug with using the polygon fog tool on touch devices.
- Fixed a bug that would cause phantom players to be shown in the party view on a server error.

We are currently working on some big changes that will take some time so expect smaller releases like this one until that is ready.
