Once you have started a game you can share a map to all other party members by clicking the Select Map button then selecting the desired map to share and clicking the Done button.

## Default Maps

Owlbear Rodeo comes with a selection of default maps that allow you to quickly get up and running by picking an environment.

![Default Maps](defaultMaps)

Currently the default maps are: Blank, Grass, Sand, Stone, Water and Wood.

## Custom Maps

When the default maps don't suit your needs you can upload a custom map.

![Custom Maps](customMaps)

To do this open the Map Select Screen and then either click the Add Map button in the top left or simply drag an image from your computer into the list of maps.

Once a custom map has been added you must configure the size of the map.

To do this there is the Column and Row properties. Columns represents how many grid cells your map has in the horizontal direction while Rows represents the amount of cells in the vertical direction.

`Tip: Owlbear Rodeo can automatically fill the Column and Row properties for you if you include them in the file name of the uploaded map. E.g. River [10x15] will create a map named River with 10 columns and 15 rows`

`Note: When uploading a custom map keep the file size in mind. Maps are shared between users in Owlbear Rodeo so if a map is taking too long to load for other party members consider lowering the file size.`

## Custom Maps (Advanced)

Once a custom map has been uploaded there are a few advanced settings available.

To get access to these settings, with the desired map selected, click the Show More button under the Rows and Columns in the Map Select Screen. A brief summary of these settings is listed below.

- Name: The name of the map shown in the Map Select Screen.
- Grid Type: Change the type of grid to use for the map. Currently only the Square type is supported however Hex will be added in a future release.
- Show Grid: When enabled Owlbear Rodeo will draw a grid on top of your map, this is useful if a custom map you have uploaded does't include a grid.
