1. Start a game to generate a unique URL that can connect you and
   your players.

   Each game is recycled after 24 hours so make sure you create a new game when you play your next session.

2. Invite players with your unique URL from step 1.
3. Share a map, roll dice or share audio with your players.

   All data is saved automatically to your computer so next session simply use the same computer and all your maps and tokens will be ready to go.

That's it, no accounts, no paywalls, no ads, just a virtual tabletop.
