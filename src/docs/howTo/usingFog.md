`Note: If it is your map the fog will be transparent for you. This is to make it easier to edit the fog and also allows you to move any tokens that are underneath the fog. For other members (who don't have edit permissions for fog) the fog will be opaque. If you want to preview what other people will see you can enable the Fog Preview option in the fog tool settings.`
