The notes tool allows you to write and share notes for other players to see.

## Working With Notes

Once a note has been placed on a map there are a few settings available for them. To access these settings click a note on the map.

![Using Notes](usingNotes)

An overview of each setting is listed below:

- Text: allows you to write text that is then displayed on the note. Using Shift + Enter will allow you to add a new line.
- Color: allows you to colour either the background of your note or the text colour of your note depending on whether you are in note mode or text mode.
- Size: controls the size of the note each notch represents how many grid cells the token takes up in the horizontal direction.
- Hide / Show (GM Only): toggle the visibility of the note.
- Lock / Unlock (GM Only): when a note is locked it can't be moved until it is unlocked again.
- Note Mode / Text Mode (GM Only): toggle whether the note will have a background or just text.

To delete a note drag in into the delete button that appears when dragging.
