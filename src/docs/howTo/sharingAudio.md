While using Owlbear Rodeo you can share your computers audio to other party memebers.

To accomplish this Owlbear Rodeo uses the audio portion of a browsers screen share support. This means that sharing audio relies on a browser that supports this functionality (currently this is Google Chrome and the new Microsoft Edge). What kind of audio you can share depends on the operating system you are using. Currently Google Chrome on Windows allows you to share the audio of any tab or an entire screen while on MacOS you can only share the audio of a tab. The limited support is why this feature is marked as experimental.

`Note: Even though sharing audio requires a supported browser, receiving audio works on all browsers`

To use audio sharing click the Start Radio Stream button in the bottom left to open the Radio Screen then click Start Radio. The browser will then ask to share your screen, click on the Chrome Tab option and select your tab. Insure to select the Share Audio Checkbox and finally click Share.

`Note: Although Owlbear Rodeo uses the screen sharing functionality, only your audio is sent to the other players in the party`

To stop sharing your audio you can either click Stop on the share banner at the top of the screen or open the Radio Screen and click Stop Radio.
